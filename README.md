# SADX Debug Mode by PkR

Debug Mode is a mod for Sonic Adventure DX PC (2004) that displays various debug information on screen.

**Using the mod**

1) Press the Z button on the controller or the B key on the keyboard to toggle between different debug information screens. Alternatively, press 1-9 on the keyboard to show a specific screen.
2) If you press the Z button (or the B key on the keyboard) while also holding the A button (or its keyboard counterpart), vanilla debug mode will be enabled. To disable it, press the same button/key combination again.
3) Press P on the keyboard to enable Crash Log. This will log each texture list and object code change to the SADX Mod Loader log/console.
4) Press Pause/Break on the keyboard the freeze and unfreeze the game. Press Insert to advance one frame forward.
5) In the Sound Queue screen, press H on the keyboard to toggle between decimal, hexadecimal and soundbank representations of sound IDs. In the LS Palette and Stage Lights screens, press H on the keyboard to toggle between multiple LS Palette Data and Stage Light Data entries for the current stage.
6) Press the C button on the controller or the C key on the keyboard to enable or disable collision data display.
7) Press T to toggle textures.
8) Press F to toggle fog.

For better legibility enable the "Hide HUD" code in SADX Mod Manager before running the game with this mod.

**Using the vanilla debug mode**

This is SADX' built-in debug mode (what's left of it). Collision objects are visible in this mode.
When this mode is enabled, you can move the character freely through any obstacles. Use the analog stick to position the character on the X and Z plane. Hold the X button to move the character up and down.

Notes:
1) Keyboard-based functionality will not work when the Input mod is enabled.
2) Vanilla debug mode is unavailable for Gamma. 
3) For Tails and Big it will display collision objects but free movement will not be available.
4) The information in LS Palette and Stage Lights screens is irrelevant when using Lantern Engine.
5) Some transparent objects may flicker when using frame advance.
6) Some debug text may not display properly when using frame advance.
7) Pressing (as opposed to holding) buttons may not work correctly when using freeze frame/frame advance.
